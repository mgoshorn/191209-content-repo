    <!-- 1. Inline styling - Assigning directly on the tag -->
    <!--      Highest Priority -->

    <!-- Styling has become heavier as web development has grown, inline
    styling is especially cluttery. -->
    <!-- Completely unreusable -->
    <!-- Don't use unless absolutely necessary -->


    <!-- 2. Style tag - A tag that goes in the header, and supply rules -->
    <!--      Style tag rules are less prioritized than inline but more than external-->
    <!--      Removes cluttering from the tags, placse it in HTML file -->
    <!--      Not reusable outside of the page -->

    <!-- 3. External Stylesheet - External file which is loaded in and
            provides rules-->
    <!--      Lowest Priority among these types -->
    <!--      No styling rules in HTML document at all -->
    <!--      Reusable across entire website-->
